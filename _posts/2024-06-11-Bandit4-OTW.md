> Someone is hidding something

Level 4
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 3 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit3 -> 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html). Just like in previous levels, we will learn how to get or view the content of a file, but now it's a *hidden* one.

Hidden files
======
>NOTE: In Linux like systems you can create hidden files or directories using a `.` at the begining of the filename.

When we are connected to the level 3, using `ls` we can see that there is a inhere directory, at this moment you can use your knoledge and command of movility in the terminal to navigate through the directory and concat whatever it's inside:

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
```

After using `ls` we don't get any output, just like if the directory were empty. This is the feature of the hidden files or directories, the exercise tells that in the `/inhere` directory exist a file, to display hidden file you can use the `-a` flag for the `ls` command that ***displays all the hidden files*** on a directory.

>NOTE: Whenever you want to know extra features of a command you can use the **help panel** or the ***manual*** of the command, to use the help panel in most Linux commands you can use `[command] --help` or `[command] -h` and to enter into the manual section you can use the `man` command:

```bash
#for the `ls` command:
ls --help
[SNIP]

ls -h
[SNIP]

man ls
[SNIP]
```
> To exit the manual you can use the `q` key.

Using the `-a` flag in the `ls` command you can combine flags to combine options of a command to display all the hidden files in a long format:

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 Jun 11 04:49 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Jun 11 04:49 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Jun 11 04:49 ...Hiding-From-You
```

After that you notice that there is a file called `...Hiding-From-You`, with this information you can perform a cat to this file to reveal the password:
```bash
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ...Hiding-From-You
[SNIP]
```

> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
