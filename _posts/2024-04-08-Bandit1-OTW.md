> Let's look the content inside a file.

Level 1
======
After completed level 0 and we are succesfully connected to Over The Wire  we are focusing on the first level of OTW: [Bandit0 -> 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html). In this level, we will learn how to get or view the content inside a file.

Testing and confirming connection
======

You need to know if you are propperly connected to the OTW severs, there are some commands available to use to check the connection (This is not a mandatory step, it's always good to have a biggest range of knowledge to perform), ***you can be asking who am  I?*** because, when you log into a device you enter your username and password, in windows enviroments you profile photo and picture will be displayed your menu, but here you don't have any menu or any othe GUI. In Linux there's a command that let you know the user you are connected with, just like if you were asking ... you can use **whoami**. 

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ whoami
bandit0
```
Okay, with the ***whoami*** command you already know that you are bandit0, know it's useful to know where are you. One more time when you are connected to a Windows based system you will be generally connected to the **desktop** directory. Once again in linux terminal you have the commanda ***pwd*** to know the directory you are at the moment.

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ pwd
/home/bandit0
```

Well, ***pwd*** stands for *Print Working Directory* and It's showing you up the current working directory,now you already know the name of the folder (We don't refer to folders in linux, we call them directories, in following posts we will refer to those as it) now to get the content or get the files inside a directory we can use the **ls** command:

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```

Now, **ls** stand for *List* in a abreviated way, right now we are looking at the output, let's analize the output, we get a **readme**, with the pwd we get the next path: ***/home/bandit0***, so there is a **home** directory within a **bandit0** directory and into this directory exist a readme file, the absolute path to this readme file would be ***/home/bandit/readme***. We can use the ***ls -l*** command to list the files in a long way as follows:

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls -l 
total 4
-rw-r----- 1 bandit1 bandit0 33 Oct  5  2023 readme
```

The output of the command provide much information about the file, permissions, ownership, weight and modification date (Remember that, this is not a fundamental course or introduction, but if you want to learn more you can check out the following resources [Permissions](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/18/section/83)) knowing the name of the file we can display the content or **concat** it using the command ***cat*** as follows:

```bash
cat readme
```

We can also use the absolute path to the file:

```bash
cat /home/bandit0/readme
```

both commands works in the same way, it's always helpful to know various ways to develop the same action. After executed the command you will get the output like this: 

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit0/readme 
Congratulations on your first steps into the bandit game!!
Please make sure you have read the rules at https://overthewire.org/rules/
If you are following a course, workshop, walthrough or other educational activity,
please inform the instructor about the rules as well and encourage them to
contribute to the OverTheWire community so we can keep these games free!

The password you are looking for is: Z [ SNIP ]
```

> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit1**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
