> Finding a file with certain owners (group and user).

Level 6
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 6 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit6 -> 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html). Just like in previous levels, we will learn how to find a file with certain caracteristics.

Solution
======

For our luck the `find` command offer options to search files with specific owner and group. For this exercise we need to find a file with the following caracteristics on the server:

- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

We already know how to search a file by size:

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / f -size 33c
find: ‘/dev/shm’: Permission denied
find: ‘/dev/mqueue’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/stunnel’: Permission denied

[SNIP]

find: ‘/etc/polkit-1/rules.d’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/credstore.encrypted’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied
```

When we apply this command you will get a tons of `Permission denied` warnings, to solve this you need to understand [Standard Streams](https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/#:~:text=As%20soon%20as%20you%20start%20to%20learn%20about%20Linux). here we are facing a ***stderr*** output, the system value for **stderr** is **2** ... then you can make a redirection to the `/dev/null`, this file is famous in linux because it is a file and all the content that you add to it not will be saved or the `/dev/null` will neither encrease it's size. that's `/dev/null` A.K.A the linux black hoel file. Be carefull while redirecting things to **/dev/null**, anything sent there will not come back, but now we can use it to avoid all those anoying warnings:


```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / f -size 33c 2>/dev/null
find: [SNIP]
```

Now we are getting the files that have a size of **33 bytes**, to apply the others filters, we can use the `-user` and `-group` flags as follows:

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/band***.password
```

We have the path now we only need to perform a cat to that path:
```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null | xargs cat
[SNIP]
```

> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).
As mentioned earlier, It's usefull to know how to perform a redirction in linux and the uses of `1`, `2`, `0`, `>`, `>>`, `&`, tons of information about redirections are available on Internet.

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
