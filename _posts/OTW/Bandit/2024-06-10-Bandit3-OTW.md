> dealing with spaces in file names.

Level 3
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 1 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit2 -> 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html). Just like in previous levels, we will learn how to get or view the content inside a file with `spaces`.

Proposed solutions
======
>NOTE: Using **TAB** key, the terminal will autocomplete based of the portions of file names provided to it.

After using ls you will get the following stdout:

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
```

That's only a file called `spaces in this filename` an easy solution for this problem is using the TAB, you can write someting like this:

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat s
[Press TAB]
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
[SNIP]
```

Once again, like that's the only file in the directory, when you press `s` and then `TAB` as the unique suggestion for autocomplete is 'spaces in this filename', the system compleates the name of the file using `\` to get `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename`, that's the main way to indicate the spaces in a file name in linux.

But here you have some other ways that you can use to solve this level, based in previous levels:

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat 'spaces in this filename'
[SNIP]

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
[SNIP]

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
[SNIP]

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit2/'spaces in this filename'
[SNIP]

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit2/spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
[SNIP]
```
> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
