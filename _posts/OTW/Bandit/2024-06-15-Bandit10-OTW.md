> Getting the human readable lines of a file to perform some filters, we will use `strings` and we will learn how to use the `mktemp` command.

Level 10
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 9 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit9 -> 10](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit10.html). The password of the level is among a lot of information inside a file.

File type and filtering
======
#TODO: Explain how to develop a grep into a data file and how to use the mktemp command.

Solution
======


> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).


See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
