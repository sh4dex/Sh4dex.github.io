> Applying filters to in huge files, given a certain patter using `grep`

Level 7
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 7 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit7 -> 8](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit8.html). The password of the level is among a lot of information inside a file.

Solution
======

when  you are searching for coincidences or using filters in linux, the `grep` command is your perfect tool to get filtered information given a expression, the syntax for the grep command is `grep [expression] [FILE | DATA]`.

Making an ls -l in the working directory we will get the following:
```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4088
-rw-r----- 1 bandit8 bandit7 4184396 Jun 11 21:30 data.txt
```

There is a file called `data.txt` with a size of **4184396 bytes** a very large file, you shouln't try to use `cat` on this file, instead  you can use the `tail` to view some lines of the end of the file or `head` to view some lines of the begging, via this syntax: `head -n 10` with the `-n` flag flag to indicate the number of lines, in this example we will display only10 lines of `data.txt`:

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ head -n 10 data.txt
clayiest	lLjm5VHTSHINn1DR7R1BfeAP7O1M1JLp
Alaric	DhavZ8wZJTnQ5BcFJVDXYciHvPjiaSWo

Cassatt's	Rq8RRUxuo06Td6BZb7zNQF6fuyyqraW2
slipknot's	63Rb1rRuo8DN01xq4QNh8SW6T6YbN55m
```

We can relate that the file is filled up with that structure, well via the exercise sentence, we already know that the passwrod is next to the word `millionth`, we can use the `grep` command to get only the lines that contains that exact word:

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt
millionth	dfwv[SNIP]7eEc
```

Loot at that, there is only one single line that contains the word *millionth* we can easily get the password from that output, but I will show you how to get the password in a cleaner way, without any garbage output with it.

The output is divided in two columns or two words, you can use specific commands like AWK, tr or cut to deal with rows, filters and spaces in a file, but using **AWK** you can use a very powerfull programming language fully dedicated for text handling, using the output and passing it to the `awk` command we can tell to print only the last column or field, in the file text there are 2 fields, we can use the following syntax: `awk '{print $2}'` this will work .... but this work because we know that the output has only 2 fields, if there were **n** fields, we can use the `NF` variable of awk, that storages the value of the total number of fields, in this case the secnd field is the last field of the output and is also our target output, we can use: `awk '{print $NF}'`.

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt | awk '{print $NF}'
[SNIP]
```

There you have the password perfectly formated and clean, in the following exercises we may use the `grep` and `awk / cut` command much, so check it out and it is use full to review about ***REGEX*** (regular expressions).

> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).

As mentioned earlier, It's usefull to know how to perform a redirction in linux and the uses of `1`, `2`, `0`, `>`, `>>`, `&`, tons of information about redirections are available on Internet.

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
