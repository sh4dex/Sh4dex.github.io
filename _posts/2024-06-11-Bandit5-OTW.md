> Human readable files

Level 5
======
After succesfully connected as bandit 4 and connected to Over The Wire server now, we can focus at: [Bandit4 -> 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html). Just like in previous levels, we will learn how to get or view the content of a human readable file.

File command
======
The `file` command is a very usefull tool when you want to know the type of a file, because there are a large type of files and every single option has his own properties. The basic sintax for the `file` command is `file [filename]` and you will get an output like this, using a file called `myFile` and a directory called `myDir` for example:

```bash
file *
myFile:     JSON data
myDir:      directory
```

Using the `*` expression, you indicate that you want to aplicate the command for all the files in the directory, the `*` expression is often know as ***WildCard*** it is extreamly powerful when you want to work with a large amount of files.After execution, you can notice that the `myFile` is a JSON data and the `myDir` is a directory, this gonna be useful to develop the exercise.

Solution
======
You need to navigate into the `inhere` directory or display it content, you can also use relative or absolute paths for this propouse. Inside the directory are some files, 10 to be exact, as these are a small quantity of files you can use the `file` command for all the files in the directory:

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file -- *
-file00: data
-file01: data
-file02: data
-file03: data
-file04: data
-file05: data
-file06: data
-file07: ASCII text
-file08: data
-file09: data
```

>NOTE: Remember using `--` to deal with hyphens at he beginning of a filename and excludes errors.

Now you got all the filetype of the files in the directory, it's easy to recognize that the different file is the `-file07` which contain **ASCII text**, and code based in the latin Alphabet to represent information in a familiar way for humans, if you want to learn more check this out [ASCII](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

Knowing which one is the unique Human readable file you can perform a cat at it:

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat -- -file07
[SNIP]
```

> Note: The password for the next user will be displayed, in this case **bandit2**, copy the password and paste it to stablish a new SSH connection (to do so you can use ***Ctrl+Shift+C*** and ***Ctrl+Shift+V***).

See you on the next time, Keep hacking!
